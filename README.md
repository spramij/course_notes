# Course_notes

 ## An overview
 Based on the base Jekyll theme offered by Github-Pages and modified a tiny bit, this repo serves as a Ruby webserver that converts my notes in `.md` to `HTML` for web visualization.

## How can I contribute ?
Just fork the repo, modify any `.md` file and send a Pull Request !

 ## Why ?
 As an incentive to pay more attention to class and actually take notes.

 Also so that it's available to others to contribute and help out.

 ## How can I have the same ?
    - You can fork the base repo over [here](https://github.com/spramij/course_notes), modify it to your liking.
    - If you really don't like me and want to make your own, this was made using Jekyll, built on Ruby. I recommend using [RVM](https://github.com/rvm/rvm) to install your Ruby env, and then following the instructions either from [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) or [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
