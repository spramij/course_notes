- What is this ?
    - A platform I will be using to study and keep notes taken in class.
- Can I contribute ?
    - Sure ! Just fork the repo, edit the files under `docs` and submit the PR !
    - Otherwise, feel free to contact me on any social media platform !
- I want the same !
    - You can fork the base repo over [here](https://github.com/spramij/course_notes), modify it to your liking.

    - If you really don't like me and want to make your own, this was made using Jekyll, built on Ruby. I recommend using [RVM](https://github.com/rvm/rvm) to install your Ruby env, and then following the instructions either from [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) or [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
